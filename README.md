This project  was to develop a site where I could display my professional portfolio.
## Developing a Portfolio Site
- Include a page for Home, About Me, Portfolio and Contact
  - Have a design that is consistant over all three pages
  - Make sure the pages linked together
  - Have a header on each page and content to fill the page

I wanted to make sure the style of the site felt consistant throughout.  I used html, css and javascript in the developement.
The sticky header and footer is useful in continuous view of links at the bottom and access to the other pages at the top.

I added a form on the Contact page so that people could enter their information and get a response, via email.

I wanted the look and feel of the portfolio to match my personality.  I feel like the color schemes and images relate well.  I also added links to my github, linkedin and another portfolio that I had made previous from a template. 

## The different pages
- The home page is a landing spot.  An introduction to Fancy.
- About me page has more information about me.  I separated the infomation into cards and added some hover effects in css.
- The Portfolio page has some placeholders for upcoming projects since I didn't have any projects to share.
- Contact me is pretty straight forward.  I have a form on there to submit a message along with some information for a contact back.
- The Submit page is a little extra bit.  Instead of it having a blank message, I added a little css to make it match the rest of the site.  Also, allowing you to go back to the other pages from there with the header and footer.
