This project  was to develop a site where I could display my professional portfolio.
## Developing a Portfolio Site
- Include a page for Home, About Me, Portfolio and Contact
  - Have a design that is consistant over all three pages
  - Make sure the pages linked together
  - Have a header on each page and content to fill the page

I wanted to make sure the style of the site felt consistant throughout.  I used html, css and javascript in the developement.
The sticky header and footer is useful in continuous view of links at the bottom and access to the other pages at the top.

I added a form on the Contact page so that people could enter their information and get a response, via email.

I wanted the look and feel of the portfolio to match my personality.  I feel like the color schemes and images relate well.  I also added links to my github, linked in and another portfolio that I had made previous from a template.
