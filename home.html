                    I am an aspiring full stack developer, currently attending Fullstack Academy. I have been inspired
                    by my amazing boyfriend who is always teaching me things related to software development. I hope to
                    some day get a job in this career field and become full time software engineer. I'm also interested
                    in game development.
